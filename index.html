        <p>From the looks of it, you have a lot to look forward to! First thing in the morning, delicious Michael's eggs
            with toast and homemade chai latte 😊.</p>
        <img src="svg/shopping.svg" alt="Chill" />
        <p>So it looks like someone is getting their new collection of white t-shirts 😏. But watch your budget you only
            have 600,- do you know why 😯?</p>
        <img src="svg/trip.svg" alt="Trip" />
        <p>The next thing on the list is a must after that calorie dose! I hope you're ready because we have a little
            trip coming up 💪.</p>
        <img src="svg/tea_time.svg" alt="Tea" />
        <p>After such a long walk outdoors, you need to warm up a bit inside too what you say 😊?</p>
        <img src="svg/chill_day.svg" alt="Chill" />
        <p>I think we deserve some of that rest! Plus, we overdid it with the walking torch, and we'll need to replenish
            some calories, don't you think 😜?</p>
        <img src="svg/game.svg" alt="Chill" />
        <p>The birds have been singing to me that you've been wanting to play a ps3 game for a long time, so hopefully
            that's still the case 😬.</p>
