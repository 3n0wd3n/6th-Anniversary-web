                <p class="day_description">From the looks of it, you have a lot to look forward to! First thing in the morning, delicious Michael's eggs
                    with toast and homemade chai latte 😊.</p>

                <p class="day_description">So it looks like someone is getting their new collection of white t-shirts 😏. But watch your budget you only
                    have 600,- do you know why 😯?</p>

                <img src="svg/chill_day.svg" alt="Chill" />
                <p class="day_description">I think we deserve some of that rest! Plus, we overdid it with the walking torch, and we'll need to replenish
                    some calories, don't you think 😜?</p>

                    that's still the case 😬.</p>
